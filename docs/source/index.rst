Welcome to a Better Boto!
=========================

Better Boto aims to reduce the burden of using AWS Boto3.  AWS Boto3 is a low level SDK for interacting with AWS Services
and sometimes it feels too low level or too crud like.

Better Boto is a collection of helper functions to make using AWS Boto easier.  For example, it added a create_or_update
method to the AWS CloudFormation client.  It also provides some helpers for dealing with pagination operations and some
help using AWS Organizations.  Check out the API for more info.
